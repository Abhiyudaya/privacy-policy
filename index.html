  <h1>Privacy Policy for CansFit Sync</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: April 2025</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Camera Images:</strong> When you use the app’s “Add Photo” feature, we request access to your device camera. Any photos you take are uploaded to Firebase Storage.</p>
    <p><strong>Metadata:</strong> We may store basic metadata about each image (e.g., timestamp, filename) to help you manage your uploads.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Storage & Retrieval:</strong> Your photos are stored securely in Firebase Storage so you can view, edit, or delete them within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> We display your uploaded images in your profile and gallery sections to personalize your experience.</li>
      <li><strong>No Additional Use:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> use your images for analytics, advertising, or third‑party sharing.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Private by Default:</strong> All images are stored in your private Firebase bucket. No one else can access them unless you explicitly share a link or grant access.</li>
      <li><strong>Third‑Party Services:</strong> We use Firebase Storage (Google) to host your images. Google’s privacy policy governs how they handle and secure data on their servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We will only disclose your images if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Only authenticated users (you) can upload and view your images.</li>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Images are encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest by Firebase.</li>
      <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We use Firebase Security Rules to ensure only you (the owner) can read or write your images.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>View & Delete:</strong> You can view all your uploaded images in the app and delete any image at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Revoke Permissions:</strong> You may revoke camera permission in your device settings; doing so will disable the photo‑upload feature.</li>
      <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> Deleting your account will permanently remove all your images from Firebase Storage.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>

    <p>CansFit Sync is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you believe we have collected data from a child under 13, please contact us to have it removed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will post the revised date at the top and notify you in‑app when material changes occur.</p>
